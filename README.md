# DreamLayout

DreamLayout is an AI-powered architectural co-pilot that transforms minimal user inputs—such as total area, venture type (office, home, etc.), user requirements, and an optional target budget—into an intelligent design and a realistic construction cost plan. 

## Features
- Generate intelligent designs based on user inputs and venture type.
- Provide realistic construction cost plans.
- View previously designed layouts for reference.

## How It Works
1. Input your requirements: total area, venture type, and other preferences.
2. (Optional) Specify a target budget.
3. DreamLayout generates a tailored design and cost plan.
4. Browse and use previously designed layouts for inspiration.
